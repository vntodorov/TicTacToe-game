# <p align="center"> Tic Tac Toe - The Game! A very basic java project (app)! <p>

<p align="center"> <b>Tic-Tac-Toe</b> is a paper-and-pencil game for <b>two players</b> who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with <b>X</b> or <b>O</b>. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a <b>horizontal</b>, <b>vertical</b>, or <b>diagonal</b> row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
  
<i><b>The project is still in active development through regular updates with new versions. The mission is to simulate a real-time development of a project with every new version bringing new stuff - new classes, interfaces, packages and even new funcionalities.</i></b>
